    "The RAG setup worked pretty well. The system was able to find the right pieces of information most of the time, and the answers it generated were accurate and matched what we expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "20% of the answers added extra info that wasn’t actually in the source document suggesting that the model hallucinated a bit. That is however a general problem for LLMs so we took the model from the exercise as a benchmark and our model performed good enough to be happy with the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the hyperparameters:\n",
    "- We chose Fixed-sized chunking for its simplicity and relevance to the context, since the data we analyzed was a political speech.\n",
    "- Semantic chunking could improve the results, but since our model was generalizing well enough, we decided not to over-complicate things.\n",
    "- The chunk size had to be reduced from 1000 to 500, because the WatsonX embedding model has a token limit of 512 tokens.\n",
    "- More generally, parameters like retriever, top-k size, or prompt structure could improve our model, but in this context, it would rather complicate things, which was not necessary.\n",
    "- Using a simple prompt format worked fine, but more controlled prompting might reduce hallucination even more."
