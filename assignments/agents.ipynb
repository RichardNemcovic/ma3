    "For this part of the assignment, we have decided to create a tool agent which tells a weather report based on the location given in the prompt. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding accuracy, the weather data retrieved is directly from a reliable external source (OpenWeatherMap). We have done some manual checking, and the model was working according to our expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this agent relies primarily on a pre-trained language model (Mistral) and simple tool-calling logic rather than traditional ML training, hyperparameter tuning was minimal. We have used minstral large for this task, as it provided quality and reliable responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the weather report we have used mistral-large llm and retreived the weather data using openweathermap's API. To create the weather report, no complex data preprocessing was required, since the weather quries don't need any preprocessing, and the data is straightforward. We didn't feel the need to convert metrics into other formats (Farenheit, knots, etc...), since we are addressing the model on european terms. This could be one extra tool to compliment our solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how we would go about checking if the agent is doing a good job:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functionality Check: Make sure it actually calls the weather tool when someone asks about the weather.\n",
    "- Handling Mistakes: Try giving it wrong or weird input (like a fake city) to see if it can handle errors nicely without crashing.\n",
    "- Ease of Use: Test how flexible it is with different ways of asking the same thing — ideally, users shouldn't need to phrase things super precisely for it to work."
